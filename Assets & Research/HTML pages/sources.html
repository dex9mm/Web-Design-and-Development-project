                <div class="wire-box p-3 mb-3">
					<p>To solve the structural deficit in the Dublin region and future-proof the supply against climate change, Uisce Éireann is advancing the "Water Supply Project Eastern and Midlands Region."</p>
				</div>
                <div class="wire-box p-3 mb-3">
					<p>This is a multi-billion euro infrastructure project designed to create a "second spine" for Ireland’s water network. It proposes to abstract water from the Parteen Basin on the lower River Shannon. The Route: From Parteen, the water will be treated at a new plant at Birdhill. It will then be pumped to a "Break Pressure Tank" at Knockanacree in County Tipperary. From this high point, the water will flow by gravity for the majority of the 172km pipeline to Peamount in Dublin.40 Capacity: The project is designed to supply up to 330 million litres per day (MLD).</p>
				</div>
                <div class="wire-box p-3 mb-3">
					<p>Strategic Rationale: The project is framed as a critical climate adaptation measure. By diversifying the water source for the east coast away from the Liffey, Uisce Éireann aims to build resilience. The abstraction is capped at 2% of the average flow of the Shannon, a limit set to protect the river’s ecology and navigation. Furthermore, the pipeline is designed with offtakes to supply towns in Tipperary, Offaly, and Westmeath along the route, aiding regional development and reducing the reliance of Midlands towns on vulnerable local groundwater sources.</p>
				</div>
                <div class="wire-box p-3">
					<p>The challenges of water sourcing vary dramatically by region. Two cities, Cork and Galway, illustrate distinct challenges and recent investment solutions.</p>

						<p>Cork City relies on the River Lee for 70% of its water. The abstraction point at Lee Road is located downstream of the Inniscarra Hydroelectric Dam.The Challenge: The dam releases can disturb sediment on the riverbed. In August 2024, a large release from the dam stirred up manganese deposits, causing discoloration of the water supply in Cork City. Manganese is a naturally occurring metal but can cause aesthetic issues and, at very high levels, health concerns.The Investment: Uisce Éireann recently completed a €40 million upgrade of the Lee Road Water Treatment Plant. This modern facility replaces 1950s infrastructure and includes advanced clarification and filtration systems. It has also raised the site by 2 meters to protect critical assets from flooding, a frequent occurrence in the Lee valley.</p>

							<p>Galway City draws its water from the River Corrib system. . A €14 million project was completed to construct a new raw water intake directly on the main River Corrib. This involved complex engineering, including using a tunnel boring machine to drive a new 1.2-meter diameter pipe under the N6 dual carriageway and the Terryland River itself. This new intake ensures that Galway has access to the deep, consistent flow of the main river, securing the supply for the city's growing population.</p>

						<p>The sustainability of Ireland’s water management system is currently defined by a tension between historic underinvestment and ambitious future planning. Uisce Éireann has successfully established a governance and strategic framework that prioritizes ESG goals, evidenced by the rollout of the Biodiversity Action Plan, the massive ramping up of renewable energy generation from biogas, and the methodical reduction of leakage through data-driven engineering. However, the "raw material"—the water itself—remains under pressure. The heavy reliance on surface water makes the national supply intrinsically vulnerable to the twin threats of climate change and catchment pollution. The data from the EPA regarding river quality and pesticide exceedances serves as a stark warning that engineering solutions alone are insufficient.<p>
