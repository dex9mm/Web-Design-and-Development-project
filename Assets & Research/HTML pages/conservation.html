				<!-- SECTION 1 -->
				<!-- Introduction -->
				<!-- Research refference: @https://germanwatch.org/en/node/14072 -->
				<h2 class="bbh-sans">Introduction</h2>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">Not everywhere in the world does water come straight from the tap. Around 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and around 750 million lack clean drinking water. Water is vital for survival and dirty water is often the cause of diseases. Access to clean water is a human right and therefore, the United Nations advocate fair supply of clean drinking water for all</p>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">To this end, the sewage disposal is to be improved, the pollution from chemicals and waste reduced, and thus the water quality increased. In many countries, in particular where temperatures are rather hot, water is a scarce and precious commodity</p>

				<!-- SECTION 2 -->
				<!-- Understanding the challenge -->
				<!-- Research refference @https://www.wri.org/insights/7-reasons-were-facing-global-water-crisis -->
				<h2 class="bbh-sans mt-5">Understanding the Challenge</h2>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">Having enough water to go around is only the beginning. That water also needs to be transported, treated, and discharged. Around the world, water infrastructure — treatment plants, pipes, and sewer systems — is in a state of disrepair. In very poor areas there is no infrastructure at all. These scenarios are presenting serious health risks and challenges for accessing fresh water</p>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">Loss of vegetation from deforestation, overgrazing and urbanization is limiting our natural infrastructure and the benefits that it provides. Forested watersheds around the world are under threat, having lost up to 22% of their forests in the past 14 years.</p>
				
				<hr class="hr hr-blurry"> 
				
				<!-- SECTION 3 -->
				<!-- The problem with waste water -->
				<!-- Research refference @https://www.wri.org/insights/7-reasons-were-facing-global-water-crisis -->
				<h2 class="bbh-sans mt-5">The problem with waste water</h2>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">Although it's true that water is a renewable resource, it's often wasted. Inefficient practices like flood irrigation and waterintensive wet cooling at thermal power plants use more water than necessary.</p>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">What's more, as we pollute our available water at an alarming rate, we also fail to treat it. About 80% of the world's wastewater is discharged back into nature without further treatment or reuse.</p>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">In many countries, it's cheaper to receive clean drinking water than to treat and dispose of wastewater — encouraging water waste. Globally, water is seriously undervalued. Its price does not reflect the true, total cost of service, from its transport via infrastructure to its treatment and disposal. </p>

					<p class="roboto-slab">- Find a Goal 6 charity you want to support. Any donation, big or small, can make a difference!</p>
					
					<p class="roboto-slab">- Run a campaign on hygiene. Raise awareness about the hygiene issues in your community through social media, school/university campaigns or even a campaign in the neighborhood you live in.</p>
					
					<p class="roboto-slab">- Organize a clean up project for rivers and oceans. Engage your whole community to clean up a local river, seaside or an ocean.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="roboto-slab">- 4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services. Lend your voice to talk about the lack of toilets in many communities around the world!</p>
				
				<p class="roboto-slab">- Don’t overuse water. Make sure to close a tap when washing dishes, take short showers – Bathtubs require gallons more water than a 5-10 minute shower. Consider getting a water meter to be aware of your water usage.</p>
