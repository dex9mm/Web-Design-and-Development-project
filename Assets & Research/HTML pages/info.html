            Clean water is very important for people's lives. But it is still scarce in many countries.
            In this section we explain why this is the case and how different areas use water.
            We also show what can be done to conserve water and improve its quality.

                    Industries use water for cooling, manufacturing goods and cleaning materials.
                    Because of this, the water often becomes dirty and is released back into the natural environment.
                    If factories use old equipment, they waste even more water. However, modern technology helps
                    purify water and reuse it, reducing pollution and saving important resources.

                    In every home, people use water every day: washing hands, taking showers, cooking, washing clothes.
                    In many countries, water comes directly from the tap, but in some places it must be brought from rivers
                    or wells. If people learn to save water and use simple filters, they can improve their health and quality of life.

                    Agriculture is one of the biggest areas where water is used. Farms water large fields and give water
                    to animals every day. Old watering methods waste a lot of water, causing soils to dry out.
                    New methods like drip irrigation help save water and keep plants and nature healthy.

                    The energy industry also relies heavily on water. Thermal power plants use it to cool equipment,
                    and hydroelectric plants run on water alone. Old systems waste too much water and can pollute the
                    environment. Modern technologies reduce water use and make energy production cleaner.
